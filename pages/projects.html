                <p>It was a summer evening when I first got the idea to do something bigger, a project on a scale I have never done before. Hence, the Uno was born. Well... not so fast. Let me tell you its story.</p>
                <p>As I said, it was summer, everyone's free, we were going out literally every day/night. This was back in 2018. From the day I got the idea, and started coding the Uno, every day I got more and more captivated by it. I started coming late to the hangouts we had, to the coffees I and my friends went to, and to everything else.</p>
                <p>Fast forward one month, here we have it, Uno 1.0; My friends and I got so into it, we played it for hours and hours. Of course, it was full of bugs, which I was glad to fix, one by one.</p>
                <p>Now we have Uno 2.0; So, more about the project: It's the uno card game, but modernized and digitalized. It has a bunch of cool game modes, cool features like a soundtrack, playing with bots, etc.</p>
                <p>It has a full intuitive design, it has ranks to keep track of your wins/losses, and it's REALLY fun! I'll let you see it for yourself, by clicking on the link above.</p>

                <h1>Creativity Corner</h1>
                <p style="text-align: center; margin-top: 5px;"><a href="https://creativitycorner.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">https://creativitycorner.herokuapp.com</a></p>

                <br>
                <p>Driven by the success of the Uno website, I soon came up with the idea for another website - A Creativity Corner - To which people can come and listen to wonderful music.</p>
                <p>This coincided with my passion for creating music, so it was a win-win, and I immediately got to work.</p>
                <p>With this project I also explored concepts about js and nodejs -programming that I hadn't touched up on before. Like the concept of video chatting, private chatting, embed websites, etc.</p>
                <p>Recently I changed it up a bit, and now we have Creativity Corner 2.0; I love it because it has a much more simplistic design, and focuses on what it really is about - Music - and not a bunch of other things like for example the video chatting I had before.</p>
                <p>Again, I won't hold you any longer, you can check it out by clicking on the link above.</p>
