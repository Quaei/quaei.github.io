                <h1>Music</h1>
                <p>When I was little, I would just randomly sing, all the time. And I was good at it. For some reason I stopped singing after 6th grade. Luckily, my passion for music was restored a couple of years back, and now my neighbours can hear me singing nearly every day.</p>
                <p>I play the piano and the guitar, and I sing. I'm the type of guy that doesn't just go around learning all the popular songs, to show off. I learn the songs that I love, and they are usually some people haven't heard about. Try <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1_ikZcsTU0M" target="_blank">Six - Sleeping At Last</a>.</p>
                <p>I also create my own music. It allows me to be creative, and I've found out that I'm the most happy when I'm creative. I have written about 20 songs, on both the piano and the guitar, 10 of which I really, really like. You can hear some of them on my website - <a href="https://creativitycorner.herokuapp.com" target="_blank">Creativity Corner</a>.<br><span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">(Please give it a little time to load, I am using a free-hosting service, and it takes a while sometimes.)</span></p>

                <h1>Coding</h1>
                <p>This one's a bit obvious. I spend my free time coding, too. From time to time, I come up with an idea for an app or a website, and I start creating it.</p>
                <p>Example projects include: Interactive website for someone's birthday, A website-calculator to solve some of my math problems, etc. I won't go in any more details about this.</p>

                <h1>And A Bunch Of Other Activities</h1>
                <p>Photography - I absolutely love finding patterns and good opportunities in nature, and snapping the right photo at the right time.</p>
                <p>Hiking - I find something challenging in it, and I take every chance I have to reach a new mountain peak.</p>
                <p>Exercising & Cycling - How does that saying go, "Keeping your body healthy means keeping your mind healthy".</p>
                <p>The Rubik's Cube - I can solve it, in under a minute, :P</p>
                <p>Teaching - I am actually really good at transferring knowledge from my head, into words, into other people's heads. People praise me for my teaching skills, and they need me, and I enjoy teaching them.</p>
