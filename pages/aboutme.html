                <h1>Early Life</h1>
                <p>I was born in Kocani, Macedonia, on a really hot summer day, 26.07.2001. I know mum and dad bought a TV from the money people gave for me, the baby. Why do people even give money to babies?</p>
                <p>Anyway, I know I had been in safe hands, I was mum and dad's first-born, so naturally, they wanted everything to be perfect with me.</p>
                <p>Then, I grew up a little. This part of my life I remember spending half of the time with my parents, and half of the time with my grandma in Radovis. This went on for quite some time, and I absolutely loved it, both places.</p>
                <p>Even at the age of just 10, I had a passion for computers. Well... mostly gaming at the time, and computers were a little bit a rare thing to have at the time. I remember playing the Nintendo until I fall asleep with the controller in my hands.</p>

                <h1>School And Me</h1>
                <p>I've always got praises, from every school I've went to. I was taught from an early age that school is the most important thing. Growing up, I've come to realize that's not quite true. And, there are a lot of aspects that need to be looked at when talking about this. God, I could talk for hours about this, but I won't go into any more details here.</p>
                <p>What separates me, what has always separated me, from the average person, is my curious side, my experimental, thought-provoking side. I absolutely want to understand everything, from 0 to the point it is at now, It's what gives me joy, what keeps me forward.</p>
                <p>It's probably the reason why I've done so well in school too. People always tell me I am quite clever, and I probably am, even though I've learned to deny that as a way of being modest.</p>

                <h1>My Passion For Coding</h1>
                <p>Okay, so from what I've told you so far, you can guess, why does coding light up sparks in me.</p>
                <p>But here it is in my words. From the moment I got introduced to coding, around 2012, I fell in love with it. For me, it was crazy how, you start with a blank nothingness, you find a problem, any problem, and you code a solution to it, and it's yours... It's your contribution to the world, and words can't describe what that acknowledgement did for me.</p>
                <p>Fast forward couple of years of learning, I now have a couple of fun projects, with the most notable being an online version of the Uno game, and a Creativity Corner for listening to music. More about these in the <a href="projects.html">projects page</a>.</p>
